    <h2>Kelly Williams</h2>
    <p>Besides playing tag in the backyard, Kelly's first running memories come from middle school sprints, hurdles, and
      field events. Fast forward to college and she developed into distance-running nerd! A recent grad from WVU, she
      couldn't see herself leaving the Morgantown area and giving up her running goals and dreams just yet. Kelly is in
      charge of all things media and social for Morgantown Running.

    <h2>Emily Bauman</h2>
    <p>The diatetic internship at WVU brought Emily to Morgantown, as she joins us all the way from Wisconsin where she
      was born and raised, and also where she went to undergrad. Formerly a collegiate runner, she is recently getting
      into training for a triathlon. A runner since the age of 12, Emily is naturally fit for our store and has the
